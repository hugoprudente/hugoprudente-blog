For about 3 years the DevOps and **Docker** community in Brazil have being keeping a OpenSource documentation focused on the **Docker** usage for Developers.

The project was created by [Rafael Gomes (Gomex)](https://github.com/gomex/) with the idea of spread the **Docker** word on simpler and practical way focusing on the developer point of view.

The project had grown over the year and today the Portuguese one count with [32](https://github.com/gomex/docker-para-desenvolvedores/graphs/contributors) contributors.

I have being using docker daily for over 3 years now, and I notice that lately I have spend too much time explaining basic and core concepts for developers or on a "developer" way. 

Rafael around the same time have created the English version, but sadly not many Brazilian contributors worked on this version.

As I'm back to the books, consolidating some core concepts, I tought why do not join the good with the awesome, do some PRs over the Docker For Developers translating from the Brazilian version.

With that I would save my time on the core concept explaination and also help the Brazilian community!
