During my whole carrer as SysAdmin, Developer and SRE I have used serveral
versioning control tools and in the past 10 years or more I'm focused on using
Git with its popularization.

With the popularization of Git it also brought to live the Workflow know as
GitFlow that exemplifies how to use Git a consistent way.

But even with the GitFlow that has different versions and different standards
for adoption it gets complex to use it.
