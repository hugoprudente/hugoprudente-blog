During my career `coding` was always a strongly present on my roles, and this was always one of my strongest points. Back in the day knowing tools were a little bit more hard, what have caused some wheels to be reinvented like my own in-house Zabbix, master-agent monitoring tool that I even deployed to 500 machines around the whole country (Brazil).

My role was always to consolidate the infrastructure and application and make them work as healthy as possible with less effort as possible as for a really long time the team was "me and myself".

During my journey I have learned, coded, and delivered projects the following programming languages.

* C
* Bash
* PHP
* JavaScript
* Java
* C++
* Python
* .NET
* Perl
* Python
* Android
* Ruby 
* NodeJS

And on the last couple years on my actual job I have also included `Go` and `Rust` to my knowledge center and kept exercising some of the languages above.

The biggest problem on this is "how to keep sharp" on the languages when you need them or at least remember enough to not spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure out how the basic things works again and I'm facing this now, getting back to `Java`.

My last official project with `java` was a really long time ago, and as I didn't had any solid project that would take advantage of the language, so `java` ended on a black hole.

The year changed and I decided to invest more time re-learn `java`, as it is heavily used by the company and this can give me more broad directions for short and long term on my career goals.

### But how?

Yes that was the really problem! Organizing time and a routine that could keep me on track and do not jeopardize the other things that I need daily to keep sharp.

### 100 Days Of Code!

On twitter several of my followers joined the challenge to learn and study a new topic and I tough that it was a really good way to help me improve and create a routine, but I had faced another issue.

### What do I do every day to 100 days?

Yeah, not everyone has projects and ideas that can work, even more if you have an strict contract, so everything needs to be really precise to not create chaos.

So 3 days ago I have created my own [repo](https://github.com/hugoprudente/100-days-of-code) and was ready to start, but:

* What should I code? 
* How can I get back to the track?

### The trick

I have added 1 strict rule that is **"NO IDE"**, yes, the idea is to do `java` on vim reading the documentation as much as possible, over stack overflow.

As I'm really rust I'm getting all that I can from the following content providers.

So let's see how it goes! My first commit is up! 

See you all later!
