How hard is to you SysAdmin/DevOps to keep track of all the tools, platforms and frameworks available on the market?

3 years ago, [Jeferson Norona](https://twitter.com/badtux_) #LinuxTips (VAI), posted on his personal page about a project responsible to gather all those tools and frameworks and consolidate it, to our life of SysAdmins/DevOps easier.

The project was created by [Alen Krmelj](blackbird.si) and it's awesome!
